tldr: 'Alchemix is an awesome protocol providing self-repaying loans. Unfortunately, the current interface is difficult to use and there are a lot of advanced crypto concepts required for use. I imagined a mobile-first design with complicated transactions (alUSD transmutation, etc) abstracted behind gas fees.'
